## Abstract

Many data analysis tasks today have outgrown the use of Microsoft Excel.  To meet this need, new tools have been developed to process large amounts of data and visualize the insights.  As our digital world accelerates the pace of change companies must quickly make sense of thier data in order to make informed decisions.  A tool is needed to quickly provide actionable insights from large amounts of data to make real time decisions.  Salesforce Einstein Analytics formerly known as EdgeSpring [@fa18-523-84-EdgeSpring-Bloomberg] is a realatively new intorduction to this market.  Einstein Analytics approcahes the challenge of gathering insights from data by making the creation of analytics dashboards easy for a business analyst.  The foundation of the tool is a compression and search algorithm that allows for speed and mobile capibility.  This paper will explore Einstein Analytics as a use case for the importance of visualization tools in business analytics.  Other tools such as Tableau and Microsoft Excel will be explored to provide additional examples.  Using these examples I will provide insights into how business analytics is evolving to make use of big data in decision making.
