## Project Location

As an alternative to a formal paper I am contributing to the Raspberry Pi epub.  A link to the contribution can be found below.  

[Sensor Contributions](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/fa18-523-84/blob/master/paper/sensors.md)

## Outline

### Contribute to sensor specific sections

  * DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
  * DHT11 Humidity Sensor
  * 5v Relay Module
  * Light Sensor
  * Touch Sensor
  * LCD Screen  
 
**TODO**  

  * Motion Sensor
  * Sound Sensor
  * *Maybe sync to Alexa?*
 

### Sample Project
 * Learning Objectives:  Understand how different IoT sensors work.  Integrate sensors into an application.
 * Introduction:  Introduction of what the project will be building
 * What you need:  list of items needed to replicate the project
 * How to set up each sensor:  Overview of how the collection of sensors is wired with reference to wiring for each individual sensor.
 * Using the sensors in an application:  The code and set up needed to read the data and do something with it.  Will have all the code in the document.
 * Conclusion and next steps: Reference to setting up cassandra database and building an application to display the data in charts.
