### Sample Project
 * Learning Objectives:  Understand how different IoT sensors work.  Integrate sensors into an application.
 * Introduction:  Introduction of what the project will be building
 * What you need:  list of items needed to replicate the project
 * How to set up each sensor:  Overview of how the collection of sensors is wired with reference to wiring for each individual sensor.
 * Using the sensors in an application:  The code and set up needed to read the data and do something with it.  Will have all the code in the document.
 * Conclusion and next steps: Reference to setting up cassandra database and building an application to display the data in charts.
