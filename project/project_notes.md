Notes for the class project
===========================

**Project: Attempt to build a smart theromstat**

  * Use raspberry pi to collect data and manage temperature.
  * Send data to cloud to store in a database and to run analytics
  * Combine weather forecast data to help predict what the temperature should be set at
  * Look at how expenses have improved as a result. Graph savings and energy usage.
  * Create an interface to look at this data.
