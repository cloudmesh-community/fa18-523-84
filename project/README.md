Raspberry Pi IOT - Smart Thermostat & Cloud Data Storage
========================================================

**Overview**
This project aims to explore how the internet of things works by building a smart thermostat.  The thermostat will collect data about the current indoor environment as well as the outdoor environment.  This data will be sent to a cassendra NoSQl cluster that is run in the cloud.  This data will be accessed by the thermostat as well as an application that can be accessed to view the data.
