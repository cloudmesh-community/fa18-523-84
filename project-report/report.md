## Abstract

The internet of things is connecting everything from our toothbrush to our car.  Smart devices like these collect data, and companies are using this data to improve our experience and also learn about us in the process.  The purpose of this paper is to provide a window to the internet of things and the complexities involved in collecting, storing and utilizing data.  To do this, I will walk through the process of building a smart thermostat.  This involves designing sensors and a program to collect and react to the data about the environmnet.  Also, this involves storing the data in the cloud and allowing users to view trends about the data through an application.  Along the way I will provide insight into current technologies that are being used in the development of the internet of things.


## Introduction

Motivation for choosing the project.  Brief background on IOT.

## Sensors: Animating Everyday Objects

Creating the sensor array for the smart thermostat.  What sensors are being used in smart devices today?

## Storage: Managing the Growth of Data

Choosing and creating a database in the cloud to store sensor data.  What database technologies are being used for IOT applications?

## Applications: Enhancing the User Experience with Data

Development of an application that allows the user to see the data.  How do businesses use data to enhance the user experience?

## Conclusion

Lessons learned, impacts of IOT, whats next?
