Apache HAWQ is a Hadoop SQL database built for massively parallel processing.  The database offers advanced parallel processing combined with machine learning tools and the scalability of Hadoop [01].  The architecture of Apache HAWQ aims to provide low latency query responses that can scale to datasets as large as a petabyte [01].  This results a reduction of time needed to explore large datasets and implement complex machine learning models.  The improved query speed is also beneficial for consumer applications that rely on learning models and big data.  Another benefit of Apache HAWQ is its compatibility with SQL based applications as the database is ANSI SQL compliant.  Business Intelligence and data visualization tools are also compatible allowing easy exploration of large datasets with increased speed.  The compatibility and similarity allows a user to leverage familiar skills to work with the database and achieve the desired results [01].

Apache HAWQ is native to Hadoop which allows for easy scaling of nodes to handle capacity or performance requirements [01]. The tool also provides easy integration of Apache MADlib machine learning libraries that can be used to work with data in Apache HAWQ.  As of Aug 15, 2018 Apache HAWK was approved as a top level project for the Apache Software Foundation [01].  As momentum increases new features and bug fixes are planned to be implemented in order to improve the tool.

The project is continuing to move forward but in February of 2018 the organization Pivotal decided to end the availability of HAWQ (Pivotal HDB) [02].  In the early design of HAWQ Pivotal was a key player in the development through the creation of the Pivotal Greenplum enterprise database [01].  Now the project will continue as an open source project.

Pivotal HDB is the Apache Hadoop native SQL database powered by Apache
HAWQ for data science and machine learning workloads
[@www-apache-hqwq]. It can be used to gain deeper and actionable
insights into data with out the need from moving data to another
platform to perform advanced analytics. Few important problems that
Pivot HDB address are as follows Quickly unlock business insights with
exceptional performance, Integrate SQL BI tools with confidence and
Iterate advanced analytics and machine learning in database
support. Pivotal HDB comes with an elastic SQL query engine which
combines MPP-based analytical performance, roboust ANSI SQL compliance
and integrated Apache MADlib for machine learning
[@www-pivotalhdb].
